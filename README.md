# Random Mobs Spawning

## Description

This mod ensures chaos will ensue in your world, with random mobs spawning at a set interval of your choice.

Enable/disable mob spawning or change spawning interval in the mod's .toml config file.
Each mob has their own chance of spawning, with more damaging and tougher mobs (even bosses!) being much rarer to spawn.

You deserve the 30 second headstart!
